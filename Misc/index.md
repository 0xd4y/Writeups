# OverTheWire

<a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/">OverTheWire</a> is a website that contains many different wargames ranging from learning Unix, binary exploitation, scripting, along with many other fun and instructional challenges.

## Narnia

This challenge was about binary exploitation. There were a total of nine binaries which increased in difficulty after each exploit. Common binary exploitation techniques are discussed in this report including ret2libc, shellcode injection, format string exploitation, among others.

## Behemoth

Behemoth is the sequel to Narnia and is rated to be slightly harder. In comparison to Narnia, it involved more reverse engineering exercises, and required more knowledge of C. Each binary was able to be exploited differently, ranging from PATH environment variable privilege escalation to buffer overflows, format string exploits, and bypassing shellcode filtering.
