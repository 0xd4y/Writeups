### Easy


## Avengers

A fun CTF-like box with an easter egg and cool (unintended) foothold. I root this box in a quite unique way, which the author of the box certainly did not intend.

#### Medium


## Keldagrim

A realistic box. Many things were learned during this challenge, and I highly recommend reading this writeup.
