###### TryHackMe Writeups

### Easy

## Archangel
This box is a great introduction to the exploitation of a web server. It involves exploiting a web service through an LFI vulnerability and upgrading that to an RCE exploit via log poisoning. The method of escalating to root privileges is also instructive.

## Avengers

A fun CTF-like box with an easter egg and cool (unintended) foothold. I root this box in a quite unique way, which the author of the box certainly did not intend.

## Wreath Network

This challenge involved exploiting a vulnerable network of three computers. Two of which were susceptible to exploitations of outdated software. The last machine involved a unique foothold centered around the creation of a malicious image file. I highly encourage you to read this writeup, as I go into detail about how Mimikatz, evil-winrm, and network pivoting work.

#### Medium

## Develpy

This box had a fun foothold, and it was a nice little challenge that showed the importance of making your programs secure. I highly recommend you read this writeup, as after exploiting the program, I go over how to patch it to make it more secure.

## Keldagrim

A realistic box. Many things were learned during this challenge, and I highly recommend reading this writeup.

##### Hard

## PythonPlayground

Python has a lot of features that some people may not know about. In this challenge, it was important to be creative throughout each step of exploitation and piece each compromised puzzle piece together.
