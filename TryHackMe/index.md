###### TryHackMe Writeups

### Easy


## Avengers

A fun CTF-like box with an easter egg and cool (unintended) foothold. I root this box in a quite unique way, which the author of the box certainly did not intend.

#### Medium

## Develpy

This box had a fun foothold, and it was a nice little challenge that showed the importance of making your programs secure. I highly recommend you read this writeup, as after exploiting the program, I go over how to patch it to make it more secure.

## Keldagrim

A realistic box. Many things were learned during this challenge, and I highly recommend reading this writeup.

##### Hard

## PythonPlayground

Python has a lot of features that some people may not know about. In this challenge it was important to be creative throughout each step of exploitation.
