###### 0xd4y Writeups

Here I publish my writeups from TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and other sites. Instead of simply rooting a machine, I go over why exploits worked the way they did, and how these vulnerabilities were patched or could be patched. For each writeup, I go over my thought process as it may be insightful to hear how certain attack vectors were identified. I write each writeup as detailed as possible, and I hope that you can learn as much from reading my writeups as I do from making them!

It typically involves black-box penetration testing environments. I higly encourage you to read my <a href="https://0xd4y.github.io/Writeups/HackTheBox">HackTheBox writeups</a>!
