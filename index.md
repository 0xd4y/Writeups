###### 0xd4y Writeups

Here I publish my public report from various penetration tests that I have conducted. Instead of simply rooting a machine and writing down its vulnerabilities, I go over why exploits worked the way they did, and how these vulnerabilities could be patched. For each report, I go over my thought process as it is insightful to hear how certain attack vectors were identified. This analysis is essential for clients so as to not only assist them in patching vulnerabilities, but to also prevent the same mistakes from happening again. 

# About Me

![Beach Chess](images/beach_chess.jpg#center)

With a track record of over 200 machines penetrated and secured, I have a 100% success rate in cybersecurity engagements in both red and blue team aspects.

Along with being ranked in the top 0.1% of HackTheBox, I am in the top 0.1% of TryHackMe, the largest cybersecurity real-world lab service in the world.

Additionally, with 15 years of competitive chess under my belt, I am an experienced problem-solver and am skilled at being focused in intense, high-pressure environments. My proficiency in being a logical and creative thinker in chess has poured into my abilities of being a well-rounded and sharp penetration tester and security engineer.

I am a team player and open-minded individual who is looking to learn as much as possible. Writing these reports not only helps in solidfiying knowledge gained from an engagement, but also results in learning concepts and tactics beyond the surface level of the vulnerable system. I decided to publish these unconfidential reports in order to share some of my knowledge with the public. This was accomplished in hope that the reader will learn from reading my reports just as much as I do from writing them.
