###### 0xd4y Writeups

Here I publish all my writeups primarily from TryHackMe and HackTheBox. Instead of simply rooting a machine, I go over why exploits worked the way they did, and how these vulnerabilities were patched / could be patched. For each box that I write about, I go over my thought process, as it may be insightful to hear how certain attack vectors were identified. I try to make my writeups as detailed as possible, and I hope that you can learn as much from reading my writeups as I do from making them!

## HackTheBox

<a href="https://hackthebox.eu">HackTheBox</a> is intended for pentesters already familiar with cybersecurity. It has many fun and instructive challenges that you can learn a lot from. It typically involves black-box penetration testing environments. I higly encourage you to read my <a href="https://0xd4y.github.io/Writeups/HackTheBox">HackTheBox writeups</a>!

## TryHackMe

<a href="https://tryhackme.com">TryHackMe</a> tends to have easier challenges than HackTheBox, but sometimes there are boxes that can prove to be a real challenge. In any case, there is a lot to learn from this website, and I encourage you to try it out. Come check out my <a href="https://0xd4y.github.io/Writeups/TryHackMe">TryHackMe writeups</a>!
