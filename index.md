# Welcome to 0xd4y Writeups!

Here I publish all my writeups primarily from TryHackMe and HackTheBox. I tend to go in-depth about the exploits and give you good resources to where you can learn more about a specific topic. When going through a machine, I always try to root the box (even if it is not intended). This can lead to some very interesting discoveries on how the whole challenge was created. You may be surprised to hear that sometimes the creator of a box has easter eggs laying around the system!

## HackTheBox

<a href="https://hackthebox.eu">HackTheBox</a> is intended for pentesters already familiar with cybersecurity. It has many fun and instructive challenges that you can learn a lot from. It typically involves black-box penetration testing environments. Come check out my <a href="https://0xd4y.github.io/Writeups/HackTheBox">HackTheBox writeups</a> where I complete and analyze challenges and boxes!

## TryHackMe

<a href="https://tryhackme.com">TryHackMe</a> tends to have easier challenges than HacktheBox, but sometimes there are boxes that can prove to be a real challenge. In any case, there is a lot to learn from , and I encourage anybody to try the website out. Come check out my <a href="https://0xd4y.github.io/Writeups/TryHackMe">TryHackMe writeups!</a>
