###### 0xd4y Writeups

Here I publish my public report from various penetration tests that I have conducted. Instead of simply rooting a machine and writing down its vulnerabilities, I go over why exploits worked the way they did, and how these vulnerabilities could be patched. For each report, I go over my thought process as it is insightful to hear how certain attack vectors were identified. This analysis is essential for clients so as to not only assist them in patching vulnerabilities, but to also prevent the same mistakes from happening again.

Writing these reports not only helps in solidifying knowledge gained from an engagement, but also results in learning concepts and tactics beyond the surface level of the vulnerable system. I decided to publish these unconfidential reports in order to share some of my knowledge with the public. This was accomplished in hope that the reader will learn from reading my reports just as much as I do from writing them.


# About Me

![Beach Chess](images/beach_chess_smaller.jpg#center)

I first started learning cybersecurity in January 2016 and instantly fell in love with it. My passion for chess gave me a big headstart in the cybersecurity field, as I already possessed the abilities to focus under pressure, think critically, and problem solve. Since then I have penetrated and secured over 200 machines (some of these engagements are posted on this website).

Additionally, I led and created a cybersecurity team (ZeroToHero) from the ground up, and used my experience teaching to mentor my team members to a level of cybersecurity proficiency. It was the most rewarding thing to see my team collectively grow from winning 20% of competitions to 80%, and it was only possible due to the support and respect that my team members and I had for one another.

I initially created this website because I know many people starting in the cybersecurity field feel overwhelmed. I am fortunate to have over a decade of chess experience, and I want to give back to the cybersecurity community. Therefore, I write my reports in a very detailed manner without leaving important information out so that readers can learn as much as possible without feeling lost.

I am a team player and open-minded individual who is looking to learn as much as possible. Please <a href="https://0xd4y.github.io/Writeups/Contact/">contact</a> me if you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or would simply like to reach out!
